# 01x00 Computer Networks and The Internet

internet 属于 Computer Networks

## 01x01 what's the Internet

### CN function

1. resource sharing
2. data communication

a computer network that interconnect computing devices

### nuts and bolts view

- hosts = end systemr

  - running network apps
- communication links

  - transmission rate = **bandwidth**
- packet switches

  - forward packets

  - routers and switches
- ISP (Internet Service Provider)

  - access Internet
  - Local ISP, Regional ISP
- Config
  - IP address
  - subnet mask
  - default gatway
  - DNS

### a service view

#### communication

infrastructure

#### Services 

reliable data delivery TCP

best effort(unreliable) data delivery UDP

### protocols

a protocol defined the format and the order of message exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and receipt of a message or other event

- Syntax语法
- Semantics语义
- Timing时序

#### e.g.

TCP, IP, HTTP, SMTP, ARP, ICMP, RIP = TCP/IP

#### Internet standards

RFC : request for comments



## 01x02 Networks Edge

end systems = hosts , running network apps, implements resources sharing

### Client / Server model(C/S)

- Client host requests, receives service from always-on server
- Server host provides service
- Web / Email

### Peer-to-Peer model(P2P)

- minimal (or no) use of dedicated专用 servers
- e.g. : file-sharing app, Internet telephony



### access networks

end systems - access networks - edge router

- bandwidth
- sharing or dedicated

#### home end systems

- Dialup via modem
  - up to 56Kbps
  - can't surf and phone at same time : can't be always on
  - D/A & A/D
- DSL数字用户线路
  - using telephone lines
  - can surf and phone at same time
  - ADSL : asymmetrical非对称数字用户线路
  - FDM : 频分多路复用
- cable networks电缆网络
  - HFC : 混合光纤同轴电缆
  - 非对称
  - Dedicated共享带宽

#### institutional

LANs

end systems typically connect into ethernet switch

#### wireless

- via base station基站 access point
- wireless LANs whithin building
- wide-area wireless accrss mobile Internet



### Physical Media (Link)

Bit

Physical link

### guided media导向型

signal propagate in solid media : twisted-pair, copper, fiber, coaxial cable

#### twisted Pair

UTP : unshielded twisted pair

STP : shielded twisted pair

distance <= 100m

#### fiber

glass fiber carrying light oulses

high-speed

distance long

low error rate

### unguided media非导向型

signal propagate in the atmosphere and in outer space : radio, satellite channel

Radio

microware

LAN

wide-area

satellite



## 01x03 Network core

### switching

#### circuit switchig

1. call setup (circuit)
2. data transfer
3. circuit teardown

- cut through
- resources no sharing
- end-end resources reserved for call
- dedicated circuit
- 中继线 multiplexing多路复用

##### FDM frequency division

频分多路复用

##### TDM time

时分多路复用, each frame is divided into a fixed number of time slots





#### message switching



#### packet-switching

each end2end data stream divided into packets

- share network resources
- each packet uses full link bandwidth
- use the resources on demand\
- store and forward transmissions: the switch must receive the entire packet bedore it can begin to transmit the first bit of the packet onto the outbound link\

##### problems

1. store and forward delay
2. packets queue delay
3. packet loss

##### advantage

more user use network



## 01x04 delay, loss, throughput

### delay

$s_{nodal} = d_{proc} + p_{queue} + p_{trans} + p_{prop}$

#### processing delay

check bit errors

examing the packet's header and determine where to direct the packet 

#### queuing delay

time waiting to be transmitted onto the link

depends on congestion拥塞程度 level of router

##### traffic intensity:$\frac{La}{R}, L=packet \ length, \ a = average\ packet\ arrival\ rate$

 golden rules : Design your system so that the traffic intensity is no greater than 1

#### transmission delay

time required to push all of the packet's bits into the link

time = L / R, L = packet length, R = link bandwidth

#### propagation delay

time required to propagation from the begining of the link to next router

d = length of physical link

s = propagation speed in medium

propagation delay = d / s

### loss

queue preceding link in buffer has finite capacity

packet arriving to full queue dropped

lost packet may be retranslate

### end2end delay

$d_{end2end} \ = \ N(d_{proc} + p_{queue} + p_{trans} + p_{prop}) \ , N\ =\ the\ number\ of\ links(N-1\ routers)$

# 02x00 application layer

## 02x01 principles of network apps

##### application architectures

1. Client-server(C/S)

   Server

   - Server always-on
   - fixed, well-known IP address
   - server farms for scaling

   Client

   - communicate with server
   - intermittently connected
   - may have dynamic IP address
   - do not communicate directly with each

2. Peer-to-peer(P2P)

   - no always-on server
   - arbitrary end systems directly communicate
   - peers are intermittently

3. Hybird of C/S & P2P

   - chatting between two users is P2P
   - centralized service: client presence detection/location is C/S

##### process communicating

processed in different hosts communicate by exchanging messages

##### Client process

nitiates communication

##### Server process

waiting to be contacted

##### Sockets

is the interface between the app lays and the transport layer within a host

##### Addressing process

IP, port number



### Transport Services Avaliable to Application

Reliable Data Transfer

Timing

Bandwidth/Throughput

### Internet transport protocols serveces

#### TCP service

reliable transport

flow control

congestion control

#### UDP servece

connectionless

## 02x02 The Web and HTTP

### Overview

#### Web

each object addressable by a URL

Web page consists of objects

a base HTML-file

#### HTTP

web's application layer protocols

C/S model

client: browser

uses TCP

stateless

### HTTP connections

#### Nonpersistent connection非持久连接

only one file each one request

$2n*RTT + n*transtime$



#### Persistent connection

server leaves connection open after sending response

##### without pipelining

new request only when previous response has been received

$(n + 1)*RTT$

##### with pipelining

client sends requests as soon as it encounters a referenced object

as little as one RTT for all the referenced object

$2RTT/3RTT$



### HTTP Message Format

#### Method types

GET: the browser requests an object, the entity body is empty with the GET method

POST: when the user fills out a form

HEAD: asks server to leave requseted object out of response, for debug

PUT: 

DELETE:
