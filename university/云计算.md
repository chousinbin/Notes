# 8. Specialized Cloud Mechanisms

## 8.1 Automated Scaling Listener 自动伸缩监听器

①**a service agent** that **monitors and tracks** communications between ②*cloud service consumers and cloud services* ③*for* **dynamic** scaling purposes

Automated scaling listeners are ①**deployed within the cloud**, typically ②**near the firewall**, from where they ③**automatically track workload(负载) status information.**

**Automatically scaling** IT resources out or in based on parameters(参数) previously defined by the cloud consumer (commonly referred to as auto-scaling). 

**Automatic notification**（通知）of the cloud consumer when  workloads exceed① current thresholds（阈值）or fall below allocated resources . This way, the cloud consumer can② choose to adjust its current IT resource allocation. 

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chousinbin/Image/202403211411072.png" alt="image-20240321141155959" style="zoom:50%;" />

## 8.2 Load Balancer 负载均衡器

A common approach to① **horizontal scaling** is to balance a workload ② **across two or more IT resources** to increase performance and capacity **beyond what a single IT resource can provide**. 
The load balancer mechanism is a **runtime agent**  with logic fundamentally based on this premise. 

#### Workload Distribution Functions

- Asymmetric Distribution 非对称分配：**larger workloads** are issued to IT resources with **higher processing** capacities；
- Workload Prioritization 负载优先级：workloads are scheduled(调度), queued(排队), discarded(丢弃), and distributed workloads **according to their priority levels**；
- Content-Aware Distribution 内容感知分配：requests are distributed to different IT resources as dictated(指示) by **the request content**；

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chousinbin/Image/202403211412903.png" alt="image-20240321141217802" style="zoom:50%;" />



#### Exist

- multi-layer network switch 多层网络交换机
-  dedicated hardware appliance 专门的硬件设备
- dedicated software-based system (common in server operating systems)  专门的基于软件的系统
-  service agent (usually controlled by cloud management software) 服务代理

The load balancer is typically located on the communication path between the IT resources generating the workload and the IT resources performing the workload processing.

## 8.3 SLA Monitor

The SLA monitor mechanism is used to specifically ①observe the **runtime performance** of cloud services to ②ensure that they are fulfilling（履行） the contractual（合同） $QoS$ requirements that are published in SLAs.

The system can **proactively repair or failover** cloud services when the SLA monitor reports a cloud service as “down”.

## 8.4 Pay-Per-Use Monitor

The pay-per-use monitor mechanism ①**measures** cloud-based IT resource **usage** in accordance with **predefined pricing parameters** and ②**generates usage logs** for fee calculations and billing purposes.

#### Typical Monitoring Variables

- request / response message quantity 请求 / 响应消息数量
- transmitted data volume 传送的数据量
- bandwidth consumption 带宽消耗

The data collected by the pay-per-use monitor is processed by a billing management system（计费管理系统）that calculates the payment fees. 

## 8.5 Audit Monitor 审计监控器

The audit monitor mechanism is used to① **collect audit tracking data** for networks and IT resources ②in support of (or dictated（命令） by) **regulatory(管理) and contractual obligations（合同义务）**

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chousinbin/Image/202403211449004.png" alt="image-20240321144930874" style="zoom:50%;" />

## 8.6 Failover System 故障转移

The failover system mechanism is used to increase ①the **reliability and availability** of IT resources ---（目标） by ②**using established clustering technology** to **provide redundant  implementations**. ----（措施）

- commonly used for mission-critical programs (关键任务程序)and reusable (可重用的)services 
- span **more than one geographical region** so that each location hosts one or more redundant implementations of the same IT resource

### Two Basic Configuration

#### Active - Active

redundant implementations of the IT resource actively serve the workload synchronously

#### Active - Passive

a standby（待机） or inactive(非活跃) implementation is activated to take over the processing from the IT resource that becomes unavailable, and the corresponding workload is redirected （重定向）to the instance taking over the operation.



## 8.7 Hypervisor 虚拟机监视器



## 8.8 Resource Cluster 资源集群

The resource cluster mechanism is used to ①group multiple IT resource instances so that they can be operated ②as a single IT resource.

### Two primary types of portals

1. Usage and Administration Portal 使用与管理入口

   A general purpose portal that ①centralizes management controls to different cloud-based IT resources and can further② provide IT resource usage reports. 

2. Self - Service Portal 自助服务入口

   This is essentially(本质上) a ①shopping portal that allows ②cloud consumers to search an ③up-to-date list of cloud services and IT resources that are available from a cloud provider (usually for lease).

## 9.2 Resource Management System

The resource management system mechanism helps ①coordinate（协调） IT resources in response to ②management actions performed by both ③cloud consumers and cloud providers.

## 9.4 Billing Management System

The billing management system mechanism is dedicated to the ①collection and processing of usage data as it pertains to cloud provider accounting （结算）and cloud consumer billing. 
Specifically, the billing management system relies on pay-per-use monitors to gather runtime usage data that is stored in a repository that the system components then draw from for billing, reporting, and invoicing purposes。

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chousinbin/Image/202403251452581.png" alt="image-20240325145226514" style="zoom:33%;" />

Pricing models can vary from the traditional pay-per-use models, to flat-rate（固定费率） or pay-per-allocation modes（按分配付费）, or combinations thereof.
Billing arrangements be based on pre-usage and post-usage payments（使用前支付或使用后支付）.
