### 05x06 Service Tech *

service tech is **keystone** foundation of cloud

#### Service Agent

service agent are event-driven programs designed to intercept message at runtime.

- active service agent

  intercepting and reading the contents of a message

  making **changes** to the message contents(most of header data and less commonly the body content) 

  or change to the message path itself

- passive service agent

  only intercepting and reading the contents of a message

  do not change message content, for monitoring, logging and reporting

# 6 Fundamental Cloud Security

### Object Storage Interface

Various typed of data can be referenced and stored.

### Database Storage Interface

typically support **query language**, using standard API or an administrative user - interface

#### Relational Data Storage: 

rely on tables to organize similar data into rows and columns

Challenges pertain to scaling and performance

#### Non - Relational Data Storage

- looser structure
- less emphasis on defining relationship
- to avoid the potential complexity and processing overhead
- limit data portability
