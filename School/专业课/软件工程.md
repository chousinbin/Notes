# 01x00 Scope of Software Engineering

## 01x01 software crisis

1968

### Aim

solve the software crisis

### Software is delivered

1. Late 过时
2. Over budget 超预算
3. With residual faults 残余缺点

## 01x02 economic

### use 10% faster method

Consider the cost of training

Consider the  impact of introducing a new technology

Consider the effect of $CMnew$ on maintenance 	 

## 01x03 maintenance

### Life-cycle model

1. The steps (phases) to follow when building software
2. A theoretical description of what should be done

### Life cycle

The actual steps performed on a specific product

### Waterfall Life-Cycle Model(1970)

#### Requirements phase

1. Explore the concept
2. Elicit the client’s requirements

#### Analysis (specification) phase

1. Analyze the client’s requirements

2. Draw up the specification document

3. Draw up the software project management plan

4. “What the product is supposed to do”

#### Design phase

1. Architectural design, followed by
2. Detailed design“How the product does it”

#### Implementation phase

1. Coding
2. Unit testingIntegration
3. Acceptance testing

#### Postdelivery maintenance

1. Corrective maintenance

2. Perfective maintenance
3. Adaptive maintenance

#### Retirement

### Classical Maintenance

#### development-then-maintenance model

development or maintenance depends on **when** an activity is performed.

#### problem

Development from scratch is rare today

Reuse is widespread

### Modern Maintenance

maintenance occurs when software is modified, whether before or after installation

### Importance of Postdelivery Maintenance

1. Bad software is discarded
2. Good software is maintained, for 10, 20 years, or more
3. Software is a model of reality, which is constantly changing

## 01x04 Requirements, Analysis, and Design Aspects

The earlier we detect and correct a fault, the less it costs us

### The cost of corret a fault in different time

#### To correct a fault early in the life cycle

Usually just a document needs to be changed

#### To correct a fault late in the life cycle

1. Change the code and the documentation
2. Test the change itself
3. Perform regression回归 testing
4. Reinstall the product on the client’s computer(s)

### Conclusion

Between 60 and 70% of all faults in large-scale products are requirements, analysis, and design faults

1. To find faults as early as possible

2. To reduce the overall总 number of faults (and, hence, the overall cost)

## 01x05 Team Programming

1. Hardware is cheap
2. Software is built by teams
   1. Interfacing problems between modules
   2. Communication problems among team members

## 01x06 Why There Is No Planning Phase

We cannot plan at the beginning of the project —we do not yet know exactly what is to be built

### Conclusion

1. Planning activities are carried out throughout the life cycle
2. There is no separate单独的 planning phase

## 01x07 Why There Is No Testing Phase

It is far too late to test after development and before delivery

### Conclusion

1. Continual testing activities must be carried out throughout the life cycle
2. This testing is the responsibility of Every software professional, and The software quality assurance group
3. There is no separate testing phase

## 01x08 Why There Is No Documentation Phase

It is far too late to document after development and before delivery

### Documentation Must Always be Current

1. Key individuals may leave before the documentation is complete
2. We cannot perform a phase without having the documentation of the previous phase
3. We cannot test without documentation
4. We cannot maintain without documentation

### Conclusion

1. Documentation activities must be performed in parallel同时的 with all other development and maintenance activities
2. There is no separate documentation phase   

## 01x09 The Object-Oriented Paradigm

A software component that incorporates both data and the actions that are performed on that data

### Background

1.  structured methods fail with larger products (> 50,000 LOC)
2. Postdelivery maintenance problems (today, 70 to 80% of total effort)
3. Structured methods only are Action oriented or Data ariented, not Both.
4. Both data and actions are of equal importance

### Feature

1. information hiding
2. responsibility - driven desigh
3. impact on maintenance, development

### Strengths

1. postdelivery maintenance is safer
2. Development is easier
3. Well-designed objects are independent units
4. a classical product conceptually consists of a single unit
5. The object-oriented paradigm promotes reuse

### Analysis/Design "Hump"

#### In the classical paradigm

1. Classical analysis
   - Determine what has to be done
2. Design
   - Determine how to do it
   - Architectural design — determine the modules
   - Detailed design — design each module

#### In the object-oriented paradigm

1. object-oriented analysis
   - determine what has to be done
   - determine the objects
2. object-oriented design
   - determine how to do it
   - design the objects

Modules (objects) are introduced as early as the object-oriented analysis workflow 

The objects are then coded during the implementation workflow

## 01x10 The Object-Oriented Paradigm in Perspective

1. The object-oriented paradigm has to be used correctly

2. When used correctly, the object-oriented paradigm can solve some (but not all) of the problems of the classical paradigm
3. The object-oriented paradigm has problems of its own
4. The object-oriented paradigm is the best alternative available today

## 01x11 Terminology

Client, developer, user

Internal software 内部软件

Contract software 合同授权软件

Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software 商用现货软件

Open-source software

Software 

Program, system, product 

Methodology, paradigm

- Object-oriented paradigm

- Classical (traditional) paradigm

Technique

Mistake, fault, failure, error

Defect 缺点

### OOP

Data component of an object

- State variable 状态变量

- Instance variable (Java) 实例变量

- Field (C++) 字段

- Attribute (generic) 属性

Action component of an object

- Member function (C++) 成员方法

- Method (generic) 方法

C++: A member is either an

- Attribute (“field”), or aMethod (“member function”)

Java: A field is either an

- Attribute (“instance variable”), or aMethod

# 02x00 Software Life-cycle Models

## 02x01 Software Development

#### In Theory理论

- linear线性的
- starting from scratch从头开始

#### In Practice, really world

- mistakes
- requirements changed

## 02x02 Winburg Mini Case Study

### Evolution Tree Model

- the explicit显示地 order of events is shown
- at the end of episode事件 have baseline基线

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chousinbin/Image/image-20230913213441804.png" alt="image-20230913213441804" style="zoom: 33%;" />

### Waterfall Model

- the linear life cycle model with feedback loops
- cannot show the order of events

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chousinbin/Image/image-20230913213633743.png" style="zoom:25%;" />

## 02x03 Lessons of the Winburg Mini Case Study

- in the real world, development is more chaotic无序的 than the mini case study.

- changes are always needed
  - software product is changing
  - software developer mistakes

## 02x04 Teal Tractors Mini Case Study

### requirements changes may be

- Great for the company
- Disastrous灾难 for the software product

### Moving Target Problem

- a change in the requestments while the software product is being developed
- even if the reasons for the change are good, the software product can be adversely不利的 impacted
  - dependencies依赖关系 will be induced诱导
- any change made to a software product can potentially潜在的 cause a regression回归 fault错误
  - a fault in an apparently明显 unrelated不相关 part of the software
- if there are too many changes, the entire product may have to be redesigned and reimplemented
- change is inevitable不可避免
- there is no solution to the moving target problem

## 02x05 Iteration迭代 and Incrementation增量

- in real time, we cannot speak about [analysis phase]
  - analysis over the life cycle
- the basic software development process is iteration迭代的
  - each latest version is intended to be closer to its target
- Iteration and incrementation are used in conjunction互相结合 with one another
- The number of increments will vary变化
- iteration迭代 is performed during each incrementation
- the number of iterations will vary

### Miller's Law

- at any one time, we can concentrate专注 on only approximately seven chunks
- to handle larget amounts of information, use stepwise refinement逐步细化
  - Concentrate集中 on the aspects that are currently the most important
  - Postpone推迟 aspects that are currently less critical重要
  - Every aspect is eventually handled, but in order of current importance  
- this is an incremental渐进process

### Classical Phases Vs Workflows

- Sequential连续 phases do not exist in the real world
- Instead, the five core workflows (activities) are performed over the entire life cycle

### Workflows

- five core workflow are perfomed over entire life cycle
- at most time one workflow predominates占主导
- Planning and documentation activities are performed throughout the life cycle

## 02x06 The Winburg Mini Case Study Revisited

- Consider the next slide
- The evolution-tree model has been superimposed on the iterative-and-incremental life-cycle model
- The test workflow has been omitted — the evolution-tree model assumes continuous testing

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chousinbin/Image/image-20230917205651425.png" style="zoom: 33%;" />

### More on Incrementation

- each episode corresponds to an increment
- not every increment includes every workflow
- increment B was not completed
- Dashed lines denote maintenance

## 02x07 Risks and Other Aspects of Iter. & Increm.

- We can consider the project as a whole as a set of mini projects (increments)
- Each mini project extends the 
  - Requirements artifacts
  - Analysis artifacts
  - Design artifacts
  - Implementation artifacts
  - Testing artifacts 
- The final set of artifacts is the complete（完整的） product
- During each mini project we 
  - Extend the artifacts (incrementation); 
  - Check the artifacts (test workflow); and
  - If necessary, change the relevant artifacts (iteration)
- Each iteration can be viewed as a small but complete waterfall life-cycle model
- During each iteration we select a portion of the software product
- On that portion we perform the
  - Classical requirements phase
  - Classical analysis phase
  - Classical design phase
  - Classical implementation phase

### Strengths of the Iterative-and-Incremental Model

- There are multiple opportunities for checking that the software product is correct
  - Every iteration incorporates （包含）the test workflow
  - Faults can be detected and corrected early
- The robustness（稳健性） of the architecture can be determined early in the life cycle
  - Architecture — the various component modules and how they fit together
  - Robustness — the property of being able to handle extensions and changes without falling apart （不会崩溃）
- We can mitigate (resolve)（减轻/解决) risks early
  - Risks are invariably involved in software development and maintenance
- We have a working version of the software product from the start
  - The client and users can experiment with this version to determine what changes are needed
- Variation: Deliver partial versions to smooth the introduction of the new product in the client organization
- There is empirical evidence(经验数据表明） that the life-cycle model works
- The CHAOS reports of the Standish Group (see overleaf) show that the percentage of successful products increases

## 02x08 Managing Iteration and Incrementation

The iterative-and-incremental life-cycle model is as regimented as the waterfall model 

…… because the iterative-and-incremental life-cycle model is the waterfall model, applied successively

Each increment is a waterfall mini project

## 02x09 Other Life-cycle Models

### Code-and-fix life-cycle model 代码修复

#### Characterized

- No design
- No specifications说明书

#### Advantages

- The easiest way to develop software

#### Disadvantages

- the most expensive way

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chousinbin/Image/image-20230914141250780.png" alt="image-20230914141250780" style="zoom: 25%;" />

### waterfall life-cycle model 

#### Characterized

- Feedback loops
- Documenttation-driven

#### Advantages

- Documentation
- Maintenance is easier

#### Disadvantages

- Specification document 自然语言书写有歧义

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chousinbin/Image/image-20230914141400804.png" alt="image-20230914141400804" style="zoom:25%;" />

### Rapid prototyping life-cycle model 快速原型

#### Characterized

- Linear model
- Rapid

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chousinbin/Image/image-20230914143047284.png" alt="image-20230914143047284" style="zoom:25%;" />



first version is lost

### open-source life-cycle model

- two informal phases
- First, one individual builds an initial version
  - Made available via the Internet
- Then, if there is sufficent interest in the project
  - The initial version is widely downloaded
  - Users become co-developers
  - The product is extended
- Key point : individuals generally work voluntarily on an opensource project in their spare time

#### The Activities of the Second informal phase

- Reporting and correcting defects

  Corrective maintenance

- Adding additional functionality

  Perfective maintenance

- Porting the program to a new environment

  Adaptive maintenance

- The second informal phase consists solely of postdelivery maintenance

  The word “co-developers” on the previous slide should rather be “co-maintainers”

#### The "co-maintainers" of Open-source software

- Core group
  - Small number of dedicated maintainers with the inclination, the time, and the necessary skills to submit fault reports (“fixes”)
  - They take responsibility for managing the project
  - They have the authority to install fixes
- peripheral group
  - Users who choose to submit defect reports from time to time

#### Open-source software VS Closed-source software

- closed-source software is maintained and tested by employees
  - Users can submit failure reports but never fault reports (the source code is not available)
- open-source software is generally maintained by unpaid volunteers
  - Users are strongly encouraged to submit defect reports, both failure reports and fault reports
- closed-source software released roughly once a year
  - After careful testing by the  SQA group
- open-source software released early and often
  - Perhaps a month or even a day after the previous version was released
  - The core group performs minimal testing
  - Extensive testing is performed by the members of the peripheral group in the course of utilizing the software
  - “Release early and often”

#### Rapid, Fixed, open-source

- an initial working version is produced when using
  - rapid-prototyping model
  - code-and-fix model
  - open-source model


- then 
  - rapid-prototyping model
    - the inital version is discarded丢弃的
  - Code-and-fix model and open-source model
    - the inital version becomes the target product目标产品

> Consequently, in an open-source project, there are generally no specifications and no design

#### How have some open-source projects been so successful without specifications or designs?

- Open-source software production has attracted some of the world’s finest software experts
- However, eventually a point will be reached when the open-source product is no longer maintainable

#### Conclusion

- The open-source life-cycle model is restricted in its applicability
- It can be extremely successful for infrastructure projects
- There cannot be open-source development of a software product to be used in just one commercial organization
- The open-source life-cycle model is inapplicable unless the target product is viewed by a wide range of users as useful to them
- But when the open-source model has worked, it has sometimes been incredibly successful

### agile processes life-cycle model 敏捷过程

- somewhat controversial有争议的 new approach方法\
- Stories
  - estimate duiation and cost of each story
  - select stories for next build
  - each build is divided into tasks
  - test cases测试用例 for a task任务 are drawn up first\
- pair programming结对编程, 两人用一台电脑写代码, 一人写一人挑错
- continuous integration of tasks

#### unusual Features of XP极限编程的特性

- The computers are put in the center of a large room lined with cubicles
- A cilent representative is always present
- Software professionals cannot work overtime for 2 successive weeks
- No sprcialization专业化
- Refactoring重构

#### Acronyms of Extreme Programming

- YAGNI (you are not gonna need it)
- DTSTTCPW(do the simple)
- A principle of XP is to minimize the number of features
  - There is no need to build a product that does any more than what the client actually needs

#### Agile Process

XP is one of a number of new paradigms collectively referred to as agile processes

#### Agile processes are a collection of new paradigms characterized by

- Less emphasis on analysis and design
- Earlier implementation
- Responsiveness to change
- Close collaboration with the client

- ------

  A principle in the Manifesto is
- One way of achieving this is to use timeboxing时光盒
- A specific amount of time is set aside预留 for a task
  - 3 weeks
  - do their best
- it gives the client confidence to know that a new version with additional functionality will arrive every 3 weeks
- the developers know that they will have 3 weeks to deliver a new iteration
- if it is impossible to complete the entire task in the time box, the work maybe reduced
  - agile processes demand fixed time, not fixed features 固定时间不固定特征
- another common feature of agile processes is stand-up meeting
  - short meetings held at a regular time each day
  - attendance is required
- participants stand in a circle
  - they do not sit 
- at a stand-up meeting, each team member in turn answers five question

------

- aim of stand-up mennting
  - to raise problems
  - not solve them

- solutions are found at follow-up meeting, preferably held directly after the stand-up meeting
- both techniques are instances of two basic principles that underlieall agile methods
  - Communiacation
  - Satisfying 

#### Evaluaing Agile Processes

- have had some success with small-scale software development
- Refactoring is an essential component of agile processes
- Refactoring continues during maintenance
- Will refactoring increase the cost of post-delivery maintenance?
- Agile processes are good when requirements are vague or changing
- The Manifesto for Agile Software Development claims that agile processes are superior to more disciplined processes like the Unified Process
- Skeptics respond that proponents of agile processes are little more than hackers
- However, there is a middle ground. It is possible to incorporate proven features of agile processes within the framework of disciplined processes

#### Conclusion

- Agile processes appear to be a useful approach to building small-scale software products when the client’s requirements are vague
- Also, some of the proven features of agile processes can be effectively utilized within the context of other life-cycle models

### Synchronize-and-stabilize life-cycle model

- Microsoft’s life-cycle model
- Requirements analysis — interview potential customers
- Draw up specifications
- Divide project into 3 or 4 builds
- Each build is carried out by small teams working in parallel
- At the end of the day — synchronize (test and debug)
- At the end of the build — stabilize (freeze the build)
- Components always work together
  - Get early insights into the operation of the product

### Spiral life-cycle model

Rapid prototyping model plus risk analysis preceding each phase

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chousinbin/Image/image-20230921193333948.png" alt="image-20230921193333948" style="zoom: 33%;" />



#### A Key Point of the Spiral Model

If all risks cannot be mitigated, the project is immediately terminated

#### Full Spiral Model

- Precede each phase by
  - Alternatives
  - Risk analysis
- Follow each phase by
  - Evaluation
  - Planning of the next phase
- Radial dimension: cumulative cost to date
- Angular dimension: progress through the spiral

#### Analysis of the Spiral Model

- Strengths
  - It is easy to judge how much to test
  - No distinction is made between development and maintenance

- Weaknesses
  - For large-scale software only 
  - For internal (in-house) software only 

## 02x10 Comparison of Life-Cycle Models

- Different life-cycle models have been presented
  - Each with its own strengths and weaknesses
- Criteria for deciding on a model include:

  - The organization
  - Its management
  - The skills of the employees
  - The nature of the product
- Best suggestion
  - “Mix-and-match” life-cycle model

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chousinbin/Image/image-20230921195534953.png" alt="image-20230921195534953" style="zoom: 50%;" />

# 03x00 The Software Process

## 03x01 The Unified Process [UP]

- The Unified Process is not a series of steps for constructing构造 a software product
- The UP is an adaptable自适应 methodology方法论
- UML is graphical图形的
- UML diagram enable software engineers to communicate qucikly and accurately精确地

## 03x02 Iteration and Incrementation whin the OOP

- The UP is a modeling technique
  - a model is a set of UML diagrams
- UML stands for unified modeling language
  - UML is the tool that we use to represent表示 the target software product
- The OOP is iterative and incrementation in nature本质上

## 03x03 The Requirements Workflow

- Determine the client's needs is the aim of the requirements workflow

### overview of the RW

1. gain an understanding of the application domain领域
2. build a business model, use UML to describe
3. it is vital to determine the client's constraints
   - Deadline
   - Parallel running
   - Portability
   - Reliability
   - Rapid response time
   - Cost [bidding procedure]
4. The aim of this concept exploration is to determine
   - what the client needs
   - Not what the client wants

## 03x04 The Analysis Workflow

- The aim of the analysis workflow is to analysis and refine精炼 the requirements
- Why not do this during the requirements workflow?
  - the requirement artifacts must be totally comprehensible by the client
- The artifacts人工产品 of the requirements workflow must therefore be expressed in a natural language
  - All natural languages are imrecise不精确的
- Two separate workflows are needed
  - The requirements artifacts must be expressed in the language of the client
  - The analysis artifacts must be precise, and complete enough for the designers

### The Specification Document

- Specification document规格文档
  - it constitutes a contract
  - it must not have imprecise phrases like optimal or 98% complete
- Having complete and correct specifications is essential for
  - Testing
  - Maintenance
- The SD must not have
  - Contradictions矛盾
  - Omissions不一致
  - Incompleteness不完整

### Software Project Management Plan [SPMP]

- Once the client has signed off the specifications, detailed planning and estimating begins
- including
  - Cost estimate
  - Duration estimate
  - Deliverables
  - Milestones
  - Budget
- This is the earliest possible time for the SPMP

## 03x05 The Design Workflow

- The aim of the design workflow is to  refine完善 the analysis workflow until material is in a form that can be implemented by the Programmers
- Many nonfunctional requirements need to be finalized at this time, including
  - Choice of programming language
  - Reuse issues
  - Portability issues
- Retain design decisions
  - For when a dead-end is reached
  - To prevent the maintenance team reinventing the wheel

### Classical Design

- Architectural design : decompose分解 the product into modules
- Detailed design
  - Design each module
    - data structures
    - algorithms

### OOP Design

- Classes are extracted during the OO analysis workflow and designed during the design workflow
- Accordingly
  - Classical architectural design corresponds to part of the OO analysis workflow
  - Classical detailed design corresponds to part of the OO design workflow

## 03x06 The Implementation Workflow

- The aim of the implementation workflow is to implement the target software product in the selected implementation language
  - A large software product is partitioned into subsystems
  - The subsystems consist of components or code artifacts

## 03x07 The Test Workflow

- The test workflow is the responsibility of 
  - Every developer and maintainer and
  - The quality assurance group质量保证小组
- Traceability可追踪性 of artfacts is an important require ment for success ful testing

###  Requirement Artifacts

- Every item in the analysis artifacts must be traceable to an item in the requirements artifacts
  - Similarly for the design and implementation artifacts

### Analysis Artifacts

- The analysis artifacts should be checked by means of a review
  - Representatives of the client and analysis team must be present
- The SPMP must be similarly checked
  - Pay special attention to the cost and duration持续时间 estimates估计

### Design Artifacts

- Design reviews are essential
  - A client representative is not usually present

### Implementation Artifacts

- Each component组件 is tested as soon as it has been implemented
  - Unit testing单元测试
- At the end of each iteration迭代, the completed components are combined组合 and tested
  - Integration testing集成测试
- When the product appears to be complete, it is tested as a whole
  - Product testing产品测试
- Once the completed product has been installed on the client’s computer, the client tests it
  - Acceptance testing验收测试

...

## 03x08 Postdelivery Maintenance

- Postdelivery maintenance is an essential component of software development
- More money is spent on postdelivery maintenance than on all other activities combined
- Problems can be caused by
- Lack of documentation of all kinds

# 04x00 Teams

...

## 04x03 Classical Chief Programmer Team 

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chousinbin/Image/202310091400972.png" alt="image-20231009140001866" style="zoom: 33%;" />

### Chief programmer

- Successful manager *and* highly skilled programmer
- Does the architectural design
- Allocates coding among the team members
- Writes the critical (or complex) sections of the code
- Handles all the interfacing issues
- Reviews the work of the other team members
- Is personally responsible for every line of code

### Back-up programmer

- Necessary only because the chief programmer is human
- The back-up programmer must be in every way as competent as the chief programmer, and
- Must know as much about the project as the chief programmer
- The back-up programmer does black-box test case planning and other tasks that are independent of the design process

### Programming secretary 

- A highly skilled, well paid, central member of the chief programmer team
- Responsible for maintaining the program production library (documentation of the project), including:
  - Source code listings
  - JCL : job control language
  - Test data

- Programmers hand their source code to the secretary who is responsible for 
  - Conversion to machine-readable form
  - Compilation, linking, loading, execution, and running test cases (this was 1971, remember!)

### Programmers

Do nothing but program

### Why Was the *NYT* Project Such a Success? 

- Prestige project for IBM
  - First real trial for PL/I (developed by IBM)
  - IBM, with superb software experts, used its best people

- Extremely strong technical backup

  - PL/I compiler writers helped the programmers 
  - JCL experts assisted with the job control language

- F. Terry Baker

  - Super programmer

  - Superb manager and leader

  - His skills, enthusiasm, and personality “carried” the project

- Strengths of the chief programmer team approach

  - It works
  
  - Numerous successful projects have used variants of CPT

## 04x04 Beyond CP and Democratic Teams

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chousinbin/Image/202310091426477.png" alt="image-20231009142637400" style="zoom:33%;" />

### Team Leader

- The team leader is responsible for only technical management
- The team leader participates in reviews

### Team Manager

- Budgetary and legal issues 预算和法律问题
- performance appraisal 绩效评估
- appraise the technical skills of the team members 评估小组成员的技术技能

## 04x05 Synchronize-and-Stabilize Teams

### Rules

Programmers must adhere to the time for entering the code into the database for that day’s synchronization



## 04x06 Teams For Agile Processes

#### Feature of agile processes

- All code is written by two programmers sharing a computer
- “Pair programming”

#### Strengths of Pair Programming

- Programmers should not test their own code
- One programmer draws up the test cases, the other tests the code
- If one programmer leaves, the other is sufficiently knowledgeable to continue working with another pair programmer
- An inexperienced无经验 programmer can learn from his or her more experienced team member
- Centralized computers promote egoless programming

#### Experiment on Pair Programming



## 04x06 Open-Source Programming Teams

#### take part in an open-source project for two main reasons

1. For the sheer enjoyment of accomplishing a worthwhile task
2. For the learning experience
