## 11.3 Dynamic Scalability Arch $\bigstar$

The dynamic scalability architecture is an architectural model based on a system of ①predefined scaling conditions that ②trigger the dynamic allocation of IT resources from resource pools.

### Common types of dynamic scaling

- Dynamic Horizontal Scaling 动态水平扩展
- Dynamic Vertical Scaling 动态垂直扩展
- Dynamic Relocation 动态重定位：IT resource relocation to a host with more capacity

## 11.4 Elastic Resource Capacity Arch $\bigstar$

The elastic resource capacity architecture is primarily related to the ①dynamic provisioning of virtual servers, using a system that ②allocates and reclaims（回收） CPUs and RAM in ③immediate response to the ④fluctuating processing requirements of hosted IT resources 

belong to **Vertical Scaling.**

## 11.5 Service Load Balancing Arch $\bigstar$

The service load balancing architecture can involve the following mechanisms in addition to the load balancer

## ~~11.6 Cloud Bursting Arch~~

The cloud bursting architecture establishes a form of ①dynamic scaling that② scales or “bursts out” on-premise IT resources into a cloud whenever ③predefined capacity thresholds have been reached.

The corresponding cloud-based IT resources are redundantly pre-deployed but remain inactive until cloud bursting occurs.
After they are no longer required, the cloud-based IT resources are released and the architecture “bursts in” back to the on-premise environment.
The automated scaling listener determines when to redirect requests to cloud-based IT resources, and resource replication is used to maintain synchronicity between on-premise and cloud-based IT resources in relation to state information

## 11.7 Elastic Disk Provisioning Arch

The elastic disk provisioning architecture establishes a ①dynamic storage provisioning system that ensures that ②the cloud consumer is granularly（精细） billed for ③the exact amount of storage that it actually uses.
This system uses **thin-provisioning technology**(自动精简供给技术) for the dynamic allocation of storage space, and is further supported by **runtime usage monitoring** to collect **accurate（准确的）usage data** for billing purposes.

## 11.8 Redundant Storage Arch $\bigstar$

The redundant storage architecture introduces(引入) a① **secondary duplicate cloud storage device** as part of a failover system that ②**synchronizes its data** with the data in the ③primary cloud storage device.

A **storage service gateway** diverts（转移） cloud consumer requests to the secondary device whenever the primary device fails。

A **logical unit number (LUN)** is a logical drive that represents a partition（分区） of a physical drive.

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chousinbin/Image/202404011431949.png" alt="image-20240401143139906" style="zoom:50%;" />

The **storage service gateway** is ①a component that acts as the external interface to cloud storage services, and is ②capable of automatically redirecting cloud consumer requests whenever the location of the requested data has changed.

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chousinbin/Image/202404011434342.png" alt="image-20240401143417262" style="zoom: 33%;" />

This cloud architecture primarily relies on a **storage replication system** that keeps the primary cloud storage device synchronized with its duplicate secondary cloud storage devices.

## 12.1 Hypervisor Clustering Arch $\bigstar \bigstar$

Hypervisor clustering architecture: establishes a high-availability cluster of hypervisors across multiple physical servers.

- **Heartbeats** (心跳):  ①system-level messages exchanged ②between hypervisors, hypervisors and virtual servers, and hypervisors and VIMs.

  <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chousinbin/Image/202404011451474.png" alt="image-20240401145146440" style="zoom:33%;" />

- **VIM**: control the hypervisor cluster, which sends regular heartbeat messages to the hypervisors① to confirm(确认) that they are up and running. ②Unacknowledged heartbeat messages, VIM to initiate the live VM migration program, move the affected virtual servers to a new host.

- **Live VM migration**: a system that is capable of relocating virtual servers or virtual server instances at runtime.

  <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chousinbin/Image/202404011451255.png" alt="image-20240401145133214" style="zoom:33%;" />

**The other physical servers and the VIM stop receiving heartbeat messages from Physical Server B.**

The Physical Server B was failed, and Virtual Server C be transformed from Physical Server B to Physical Server C.

## 12.3 Non - Disruptive Service Relocation Arch $\bigstar$

> 不中断服务重定位架构

**non-disruptive service relocation architecture** establishes a system by which a predefined event triggers the *duplication* or *migration* of a cloud service implementation at runtime, thereby avoiding any disruption. 

在旧的云服务被释放之前，新的云服务保证能正常服务用户。

**A key aspect**: the new cloud service implementation is guaranteed to *be* *successfully receiving and responding to* cloud service consumer requests **before** the original cloud service implementation is deactivated（解除） or removed.

A common approach is for **live VM migration** to move the entire virtual server instance that is hosting the cloud service.

The **automated scaling listener** and/or load balancer mechanisms can be used to trigger a temporary redirection of cloud service consumer requests, in response to scaling and workload distribution requirements.

## ~~12.4 Zero Downtime Arch~~

> 零宕机

zero downtime architecture: a ①sophisticated failover (故障转移) system，allows virtual servers to be dynamically ②moved to different physical server hosts, in the event that their ③original physical server host fails.

- **Multiple physical servers** are assembled into a group that is ①*controlled by a* *fault tolerance system***（***容错系统）* capable of ②*switching**（切换）**activity from one physical server to another*, without interruption. ③**The live VM migration** component is typically *a core part* of this form of high availability cloud architecture.
- **All virtual servers** are stored on ①a shared volume so that other physical server hosts in the same group can ②access their files.

## 12.7 Dynamic Failure Detection and Recovery Arch $\bigstar$

establishes a **resilient(弹性) watchdog system** to ①monitor and ②respond to a wide range of pre-defined failure scenarios（场景）.

- This system ①notifies and ②**escalates**(升级) the failure conditions that it cannot automatically resolve itself.
- It relies on the **intelligent watchdog monitor** to ①actively track IT resources and ②take pre-defined actions in response to pre-defined events
